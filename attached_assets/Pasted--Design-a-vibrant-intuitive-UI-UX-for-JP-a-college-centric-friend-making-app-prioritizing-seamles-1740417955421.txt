"Design a vibrant, intuitive UI/UX for JP, a college-centric friend-making app, prioritizing seamless social interactions and safety. Follow these guidelines:

1. Core Structure

Default Home Screen: Implement a Tinder-like swipe interface as the primary screen. Display user cards with name, age, branch, hostel/localite status, and hobbies. Use large, playful buttons (âœ“/âœ—) for swiping, with a floating match-notification icon (top-right).

Navigation: Use a 5-tab bottom bar: Home (swipe), Confessions, Memes, Q&A, and Profile.

2. Key Features

Instagram Integration: Add a small Instagram badge (ðŸ“¸) next to profile names. On tap, display the handle in a subtle popup without embedding feeds.

Mandatory Face Detection:

Trigger during signup (full-screen overlay with playful animations guiding users to align their face).

Re-trigger for sensitive actions (e.g., posting confessions, video calls) using a minimal modal with camera guidelines.

Dedicated Memes Feed: Create a TikTok-style vertical scroll feed under a â€˜Memesâ€™ tab. Allow anonymous posting with tagging (e.g., #CollegeHumor). Include upvote/downvote counters and a â€˜Shareâ€™ button.

3. Visual Style

Color Palette: Youthful and energeticâ€”use gradients of teal (#2DD4BF) and coral (#FF6B6B) for CTAs, with soft white/gray backgrounds. Accent safety features (block/report) in red (#FF3B30).

Typography: Rounded sans-serif fonts (e.g., Poppins) for readability. Use bold headers (20pt) and clean body text (14pt).

Icons: Outline-style icons for tabs, filled states for active selections.

4. Safety & Anonymity

Highlight anonymity toggles (e.g., masks for confessions, Q&A).

Add persistent block/report buttons on profiles and posts.

5. Interactive Elements

Confessions/Q&A: Card-based feeds with blurred avatars. Let users toggle anonymity when commenting.

Profile Setup: Multi-step forms with progress bars. Use chips for selecting hobbies/interests.

Deliverables:

Wireframes for core screens (swipe, memes feed, profile setup).

High-fidelity mockups emphasizing color hierarchy and interactions.

Micro-animations for swiping, face detection, and match notifications.

Tone: Friendly and approachable, with subtle humor (e.g., meme-inspired loading screens). Avoid clutterâ€”prioritize whitespace and clear CTAs.
